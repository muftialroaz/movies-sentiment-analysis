# Movies Sentiment Analysis

The Movie Sentiment Analysis project aims to analyze user sentiments or opinions about movies based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset consists of a collection of user reviews about various films, which are associated with positive or negative sentiment labels.

In this project, I will use sentiment analysis techniques to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The main goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the opinions, feelings, or responses contained within user reviews. Thus, this project will provide insights into how the public responds to specific films and can be used to track sentiment trends in the film industry.

Target: 0 - Negative, 1 - Positive
